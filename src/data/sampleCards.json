    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a direct cost and an indirect cost?",
      "answer": "A direct cost can be easily traced to the cost object (e.g., direct materials, direct labor). An indirect cost cannot be easily traced and must be allocated (e.g., indirect materials, indirect labor, other overhead)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the same cost be direct or indirect?",
      "answer": "The classification of a cost as direct or indirect depends on the cost object. For example, the cost of plant and equipment depreciation is an indirect cost for one Prius, but a direct cost for the Prius manufacturing plant."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between product costs and period costs?",
      "answer": "Product costs are associated with producing or purchasing inventory (Production/Purchases part of the value chain). Period costs are all other costs not related to inventory (other parts of the value chain like R&D, design, marketing, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are product costs and period costs treated for accounting purposes?",
      "answer": "Product costs are first accumulated as Inventory on the Balance Sheet and then expensed as Cost of Goods Sold on the Income Statement when items are sold. Period costs are immediately expensed as Operating Expenses on the Income Statement when incurred."

    },
    {
      "question": "What is an allocation base?",
      "answer": "A measure chosen as the basis for how indirect costs will be divided up and assigned to individual jobs. Ideally, it should be a cost driver."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can job cost record information be used for making decisions?",
      "answer": "To reduce future job costs, compare profitability of different products, deal with pricing pressure, decide on discounts for high-volume sales, bid on custom orders, and prepare financial statements."

    },
    {
      "question": "What is Activity-Based Costing (ABC)?",
      "answer": "A refined cost allocation system that groups indirect costs into 'activities' or 'cost pools,' and then uses separate allocation rates for each activity to assign costs to jobs/products more accurately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Activity-Based Costing (ABC) considered more accurate?",
      "answer": "ABC is the most refined allocation system because it considers the specific resources each product uses and the extent to which it uses them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Direct Materials and Direct Labor affected by the choice of cost allocation system (traditional vs. ABC)?",
      "answer": "No, because they are traced, not allocated. Only Manufacturing Overhead is affected."

      "question": "When are the benefits of ABC/ABM higher for companies?",
      "answer": "For companies in competitive markets and companies with a high risk of cost distortion (e.g., many different products, high indirect costs, varied production volumes)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When are the costs of ABC/ABM lower for companies?",
      "answer": "For companies that already have sophisticated accounting systems/software or information technology (like barcoding) to compile cost driver data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some signs that an old cost system may be distorting costs?",
      "answer": "Managers are confused by costs/profits, bids are won/lost unexpectedly, competitors price similar products much lower profitably, employees doubt cost figures, the system is outdated, new products or production changes haven't led to system updates."

    },
    {
      "question": "What are total costs (or mixed costs)?",
      "answer": "Costs that contain both fixed and variable behavior components. Total Costs = Total Variable Costs + Total Fixed Costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relevant range?",
      "answer": "A wide range of production volume where costs behave as described, with variable cost per unit and total fixed costs remaining constant."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are step costs?",
      "answer": "Costs where the total cost is 'fixed' over a very small range of activity, then jumps to a higher fixed amount for another small range. The graph looks like stairsteps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the high-low method for creating a cost equation?",
      "answer": "A method using historical data on a scatterplot to find the equation of the line between the highest and lowest volume points. Steps: 1. Identify high/low volume points. 2. Calculate v (variable cost per unit) = ∆y ÷ ∆x. 3. Find f (total fixed costs) by plugging v, x, and y from high or low point into y = vx + f. 4. Write the full cost equation."

    {
      "question": "What is Residual Income (RI) and its formula?",
      "answer": "Measures operating income above management's target rate of return on assets. RI = Operating Income – (Target Rate of Return × Total Assets). Promotes goal congruence better than ROI."
